# Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks

## Visualising CNN's

* Large Convolutional Network models have recently demonstrated impressive classification performance on the ImageNet benchmark. However there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved. In this repository, visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier is given. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. This enables us to find model architectures that outperform on the ImageNet classification benchmark.
* Project status: working
